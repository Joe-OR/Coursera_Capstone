If you cannot think of an idea or a problem, here are some ideas to get you started:\n\n##### In Module 3, we explored New York City and the city of Toronto and segmented and clustered their neighborhoods. Both cities are very diverse and are the financial capitals of their respective countries. One interesting idea would be to compare the neighborhoods of the two cities and determine how similar or dissimilar they are. Is New York City more like Toronto or Paris or some other multicultural city? I will leave it to you to refine this idea.\n\n##### In a city of your choice, if someone is looking to open a restaurant, where would you recommend that they open it? Similarly, if a contractor is trying to start their own business, where would you recommend that they setup their office?\n\n##### These are just a couple of many ideas and problems that can be solved using location data in addition to other datasets. No matter what you decide to do, make sure to provide sufficient justification of why you think what you want to do or solve is important and why would a client or a group of people be interested in your project.","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## WEEK 1\n##### For this week, you will required to submit the following:\n###### 1.

The neighborhood should have some amenities that the parents would benefit from as well as some amenities for the children to avail of.\n\nProblem Statment:\nThe parents of the family would like to live within walking distance of at least one pub, bar or restaurant.\nThe children would like to live in a neighborhood that is close to one or more of the following amenities:\n- A Sports Club\n- A Park\n- A Playground\n- A Toy / Game Store\n- A Movie Theater (Cinema)","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"\n###### 2. A description of the data and how it will be used to solve the problem. (15 marks)\n\nThe primary dataset that will be used in this analysis is available at the following link:\nhttps://cf-courses-data.s3.us.cloud-object-storage.appdomain.cloud/IBMDeveloperSkillsNetwork-DS0701EN-SkillsNetwork/labs/newyork_data.json \n\nThis json file contains a list of the neighborhoods in new york along with the location data (latitude, longitude). This json file will be read into a pandas dataframe for the analysis. The project will then use this location data in conjunction with the Foursquare API to explore which amenities/venues are nearby each neighborhood. \n\nWe will use this data from Foursquare to filter the neighborhoods of New York to ensure that only neighborhoods that are suitable for both the parents and the children are considered in our analysis. To do this, we will only consider neighborhoods within 1,500m of either a Pub, Bar or Restaurants. This should satisfy the parents' wants. We will also only consider neighborhoods that are within a similar distance of either a Sports Club, Park, Playground, Toy Store or Cinema to satisfy the childrens' needs.\n\nThe initial analysis of this project will not consider house prices in the analysis. However, it may be worth including another dataset containing regional house price data, as that would obviously have a big impact on the decision of which neighborhood to live in.\n\nWe will perform k-means clustering on the filtered data to cluster the neighborhoods.","metadata":{}}]}
